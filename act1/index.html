			<h1 style="color:#FFFFFF">ACT 1</h1>
			<p style="color:#AAAAAA">Hello everyone, it's good to meet you. You may call me "The Gamemaster".</p>
			<p style="color:#AAAAAA">By now, my lovely assistant Iyan should have split you up into three teams: <span style="color:#00ffffff;">Cyan</span>, <span style="color:#ff00ff">Magenta</span>, and <span style="color:#ffff00">Yellow</span>.<br />No doubt you have all assumed it was a ploy to divide you, or a fun little competition.</p>
			<p style="color:#AAAAAA">Oh how naive.</p>
			<p style="color:#AAAAAA">I will refrain from telling you the purpose of the teams outright, you should be smart enough to figure that out on your own.</p>
			<p style="color:#AAAAAA">For now, all you need to know is that there are a few questions I need answered and puzzles I need solved.<br />Believe it or not, you're all I could find for the job. If you help me out, there might be something in it for you as well. I'll leave it up to you.</p>
			<p style="color:#AAAAAA">If you wish to help me, then let's play a game.</p>
